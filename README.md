# Euler

Are you a student? If yes then you might have also experienced the sleepiness in a boring class, or worry to make notes as the instructor recites the lecture, or find resources for the material taught in the class on internet, or a summarized notes to revise previous topics. If you agree then this webapp is for you and for all the students like you who need a revolution in the style of learning and teaching. Keeping these problems in mind the webapp craters for all of the above scenarios in a realistic lecture. With the help of machine learning particularly natural language processing and clustering algorithms the webapp realizes the functionality that nearly solves all the above problems efficiently in real time.

## Description

Eulerâ€™s notes is a webapp that use machine learning algorithms to record real time voice of the speaker and simultaneously translating it into a text format document just the same way we make notes.

* Records real time voice of the speaker and make editable notes.
* Save the notes which can be later on summarized for revision.
* Provide important links and videos for the material taught in the lecture.
* The webapp has a chrome extension integrated with it in which you can highlight the notes and record side-notes.
* The app maintains a perfect date time data of the notes in order to make future references easy.
